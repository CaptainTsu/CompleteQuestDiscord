# CompleteDiscordQuest for Vencord

A Vencord(VC) plugin that completes you multiple discord quests in background simultaneously.

## Features:

## Installation:

1. Open your Vencord folder. Inside it, you should find a folder called `src`. This folder houses all of Vencord's source code.

2. If you don't have this folder, you have not read the previous instructions. Go back and first follow the [Installing from Source](https://docs.vencord.dev/installing/) guide.

3. Navigate to the `src` folder and create a new folder called `userplugins` (if it doesn't exist already). This folder is reserved for custom/private plugins.

4. Inside the `userplugins` folder, clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/CaptainTsu/CompleteQuestDiscord.git
   ```

5. Restart Discord or reload Vencord to load the plugin.
